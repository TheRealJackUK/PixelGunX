- fixed Flash Player implementation of the ObscuredUShort.GetHashCode()
- another minor improvements in flash implementation of SpeedHackDetector
- other minor fixes and optimizations

1.2.7
- InjectionDetector introduced
  * allows to detect if someone injects any managed dll into your app
- ObscuredShort and ObscuredUShort with cheating detection implemented
- IntegrityChecker removed (see my considerations here: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/196578-Anti-Cheat-Toolkit-RELEASED/page7?p=1577548&viewfull=1#post1577548)
- significant changes and fixes in API documentation (should be prettier and more detailed now)
- DeviceLockLevel enum moved into the ObscuredPrefs class, thus now it should be reached as ObscuredPrefs.DeviceLockLevel
- SpeedHackDetector's StartMonitoring methods were renamed to StartDetection ones
- minor improvements in flash implementation of SpeedHackDetector
- ObscuredUint was renamed to ObscuredUInt
- minor files structure changes, please, make clean update (completely remove previous version before updating)
- minor fixes and optimizations

1.2.6u2
- fixed possible false positives of cheating detection in Obscured types
- minor API docs fixes

1.2.6u1
- extra traces in ActionScript code were commented out

1.2.6
- flash build support for SpeedHackDetector implemented
- ObscuredVector2 and ObscuredQuaternion implemented
- cheating detection added to the ObscuredByte
- SpeedHackDetector now awaits Action delegate instead of MonoBehaviour and method name. Please, read API docs for details
- ObscuredPrefs.readForeignSaves field introduced
  * allows to read saves locked to other device and onPossibleForeignSavesDetected action still will be fired
- deprecated PlayerPrefsObscured was removed completely, use ObscuredPrefs instead
- ObscuredFloat slightly optimized
- ObscuredDouble slightly optimized
- all default arguments were replaced by methods overloading for additional compatibility with UnityScript (again)
- minor fixes in API docs

1.2.5u1
- SpeedHackDetector.Instance is now public and may be used to set interval, autoDispose, etc. from code.

1.2.5
- SpeedHackDetector introduced! Allows you to react on Cheat Engine's speed hack
  * some other speed hack tools may be detected too
  * use GameObject->Create Other->Code Stage->Speed Hack Detector menu item to add detector in scene
  * use any public SpeedHackDetector API to automatically add it to scene
- added cheating detection to the ObscuredInt and ObscuredFloat (use Obscured*.onCheatingDetected)
- migration from PlayerPrefs to ObscuredPrefs became super easy: just replace PlayerPrefs with ObscuredPrefs
  and read \ write any data as usual, no more manual PlayerPrefs to ObscuredPrefs conversion!
  * all data saved with regular PlayerPrefs will be automatically encrypted with ObscuredPrefs on read and
    original PlayerPrefs data will be deleted
  * Set ObscuredPrefs.preservePlayerPrefs to true to prevent original PlayerPrefs data deletion
- migration from legacy PlayerPrefsObscured to ObscuredPrefs became smoother: data, written with PlayerPrefsObscured
  now converts to the new format while readed with ObscuredPrefs (previously - old legacy keys were left untouched 
  after migration).
- ObscuredPrefs.unobscuredMode implemented
  * allows to write all data unobscured, for testing purposes
  * thus it works in Editor only
  * breaks PlayerPrefs to ObscuredPrefs migration (reminder: in Editor)
- ObscuredVector3 and ObscuredBool implemented!
- data saved in TestScene now cleans up on application quit
- ObscuredPrefs overfill in Web Player no longer breaks entire game process (and logs error in such case)
- added selftests and performance tests code to the example scene (disabled by default) for debugging and 
  making wise choices ;)
- ObscuredString default crypto key was changed. Set new key to 4444 before using SetEncrypted() to set data got with
  GetEncrypted in previous versions.
- fixed compilation error of WP8 build
- fixed initialization of some Obscured types
- fixed ObscuredString equality operator implementation
- minor fixes
- minor docs fixes

1.2.0
- project updated to Unity 4.2.2
- new ObscuredPrefs introduced instead of old PlayerPrefsObscured
  * PlayerPrefsObscured is no more supported, please, make sure to save all your new data using ObscuredPrefs
  * all data saved with ObscuredPrefs will not be accessible using deprecated PlayerPrefsObscured!
  * all data saved with deprecated PlayerPrefsObscured is accessible with ObscuredPrefs automatically as fallback
    (will be removed in future)
  * new flexible lock data to device feature introduced, read more in api docs and readme
  * now saved data may be recovered in emergency cases (like device ID change after updating from iOS 6 to iOS 7)
  * attempt to prevent device id change after iOS6 to iOS7 update (works in some cases only)
  * key is now encrypted with common encryptionKey (previously default key for ObscuredString was used)
  * accessing data saved with regular PlayerPrefs now generates warning with additional information
  * saves alteration can be detected now, use ObscuredPrefs.onAlterationDetected (see ObscuredPrefsTest)
  * foreign saves usage detection added, use ObscuredPrefs.onPossibleForeignSavesDetected (see ObscuredPrefsTest)
  * added example of storing encryption key outside of the IL bytecode (increasing its security level)
    (see ObscuredPrefsTest)
  * added support of these types: long, bool, byte[], Vector3
- ObscuredByte and ObscuredLong added
- equality operations (==, !=, .Equals()) are now supported in all simple Obscured types
- all default arguments were replaced by methods overloading for additional compatibility with UnityScript

- fixed link to ObscuredDouble missed in object Tester in the test scene

1.1.0

- Yey, Flash Player exporter support is back! :D IntegrityChecker, ObscuredDouble and 
  PlayerPrefsObscured.lockToDevice are not supported there though.
- added increment and decrement operators support to the numeric obscured types (thanks Yuri Saveliev)
- added ObscuredDouble! Not supported in FlashPlayer (use ObscuredFloat instead)! (thanks Andriy Pidvirnyy)
- added correct analogues of toString() methods to some of the Obscured types
- added PlayerPrefsObscured.ForceLockToDeviceInit() method to call device ID obtanation (noticably slow at first
  call) process at desirable time (at splash screen time for example)
- added initial support for Windows Store (Metro) Apps (needs testing)
- added initial support for Windows Phone 8 (needs testing, thanks friuns3)

- PlayerPrefsObscured.lockToDevice field is now property, so please use PlayerPrefsObscured.LockToDevice instead.
  Sorry for inconvenience.
- removed unsafe code in ObscuredFloat
- fixed possible placement in memory not obscured float while using ObscuredFloat, oops :P
- fixed possible data loss when using values equal to the crypto keys
- attempt to fix "get_deviceUniqueIdentifier can only be called from the main thread" error (thanks ecc83)

  assemblies are not valid

- assemblies signing now can't be enabled on known unsupported platforms
- assemblies signing will be disabled after switching to the known unsupported platform
- assemblies signing will be disabled if Stripping Level in Player Settings is not set to "Disabled"
- changed PlayerPrefsObscured default encryption key. Use SetNewCryptoKey(e806f69e7aea3ee30fe27a6abfae967f) to
  read any data saved in previous ACT version with default key.
